GDSC Task 3

As i am not well experienced with backend, I have some Knowledge with database connectivity using SQL and Python using mysql.connector module.
So in this task I have created a class TodoDBConnector, this can be used in the backend files to store the data in database without writing queries.

Thank you!!
